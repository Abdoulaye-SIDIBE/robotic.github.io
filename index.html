               Hello, My name is ABDOULAYE SIDIBE and I come from Mali. 
		I completed my bachelor's degree in Electrical, Electronics and Automation engineering at an engineering school in Mali.
		Currently, I am doing my master's at PAUSTI in KENYA and my research subject is based on agriculture.
		I worked on different projects with classmates based on microcontrollers and prototype design.
		These experiences have strengthened my spirit of team work.
             </p><br/>
             <p style="font-family: Times New Romand;">
               During this training, I hope to learn more about powerful microcontrollers like the Raspberry pi, more interaction with it.
		 Understand the motion process of robots and the components suitable for their construction.
		 I expect more practice than theory.
